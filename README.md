# My blog on Jekyll with Minimal Mistakes theme

I'm using Ukrainian language on it (some time later I will try to add English language too). But you feel free to ask me any questions on [About page](http://probil.github.io/about/). 

[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) is a two column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering GitHub hosted blog. Thanks [author](http://mademistakes.com/about/) for it.
